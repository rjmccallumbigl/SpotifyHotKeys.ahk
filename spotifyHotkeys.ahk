; Add shortcut to shell:Startup
; Add lib folder to shell:Startup
; In Windows settings, set .mp3 association to Spotify Windows App (Spotify.exe) by right clicking an mp3 file, selecting Open With -> Choose another app, Look for another app on this PC, find Spotify.exe. If you don't do this, Windows might open Windows Media Player or another media app whenever you press a media key.
; If you're using the Windows app, run this in PowerShell (as admin) to get exact location of Spotify.exe: "$((ls "C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\" | Where-Object { $_ -like "*spotify*"})[0].FullName)\Spotify.exe"
; If Spotify updated, the folder changed and Windows Media Player or another app may open when you press your media keys. Redo the above two steps.
; If you get an error message attempting to set Spotify to open mp3s, open Task Manager with CTRL + Shift + Esc, click File -> Open New Task, check "Create this task with administrative privileges", type Explorer, and press enter. Try it from there. Then close Explorer and see if the media keys work.

; 
; Caveats
; 
; The script will add duplicate songs to a playlist without checking and the Spotify API won't stop me. Tried to implement logic [If NewSchool.tracks [not] contains CurrentPlayback.Track.ID] but it looks like this only checks the first 100 tracks returned from the playlist. However I noticed this puts me over the 10k song limit? Starred2 has over 10k songs adding songs using this script while adding them via the Spotify player gives me an error message. 
; 
; CTRL + Play was supposed to shuffle devices
; This API appears to be bugged because it only returns my current active playback device, not my other available Devices
